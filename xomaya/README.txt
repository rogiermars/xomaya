Known Issues:

* The first few screen shots may come back blank depending on the speed of your CPU.
This is a timing issue that has not been figured out yet. This does not appear to adversely
affect the final output.

* If you encounter a FileNotFoundException during start up, it means you are missing the logs directory.

* If you encounter Invalid License Key: ERROR CODE 5 or ERROR CODE 2, this means one of two things:

A) You are not connected to the internet. Please connect your system to the internet and try again.

-OR-

B) that your license key is invalid.
